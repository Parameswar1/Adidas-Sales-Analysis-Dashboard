# Adidas-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard


🔸 This Project is about Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard.
🔸 In this Project, I've loaded clean data from excel and created visuals.
🔸 I've used Top N filter to get Top 5 performing cities
🔸 Cards are Mandatory to get easy understanding of overall sales analysis like Total Sales, Total Profits, Total Units Sold, etc..
🔸 Then, I compared Sales and Profits with different values like Product Category, Sales Method, Gender Type, Retailer Type, many more(based on data).
🔸 Slicers are the ones that make dashboard more interactive to users and get more insights.
🔸 Finally, Sales Trend is like mandatory because we can drill-down to months and days where sales are high and where sales are low which is very useful to know why sales are behaving how they are behaving.
